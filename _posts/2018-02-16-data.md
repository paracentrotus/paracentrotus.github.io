The genome of the mediterranean sea urchin *Paracentrotus lividus* was assembled using a combination of Illumina data provided by [Genoscope](http://www.genoscope.cns.fr) and Pacbio and HiC data generated by members of the Paracentrotus lividus genome consortium. After primary assembly, haplotypes were reconcilied using haplomerger.

This assembly spans 927.48Mb (scaf N50: 41.5Mb) split in 3,747 scaffolds with 5% of residual gaps. Masked regions using a custom repeat library  make up 44.3% of the genomes and are represented as lower case characters (soft-masking); residual gaps in the assembly are represented with Ns.

A draft annotation of the genome was generated by training Augustus using transcript aligned with PASA and subsquently polishing these ab initio models using EVM incoporating transcript alignment and protein alignments from seastar and amphioxus. UTRs and splice variants were added using 2 rounds of refinement against the PASA transcript aligment. This annotation contains 30593 genes (probably an overestimate) of which 23573 have blast similarity against Strongylocentrotus genes (if so, 'gene_name' field was filled based on SPU name in the GTF).
