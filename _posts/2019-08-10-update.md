title: Updating annotation and hub
---

A new server is now hosting the hub with enough memory to enable BLAT searches. The new address is [http://95.179.158.79/Urchin/hub.txt](http://95.179.158.79/Urchin/hub.txt). 

We also release a new annotation, which improves protein domain content and mapping rates. It uses different gene IDs than the previous one to avoid confusion. We anticipate to release a reconciled version of the 2 annotations in a near future. 

See [data section](http://paracentrotus.github.io/Data/) for more details. 

Good luck!
